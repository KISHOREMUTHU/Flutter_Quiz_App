# Freedom50 

"Freedom50" is a Quiz App , which provides multiple choice questions about India's Independence.

## Working of the App

 - The app mainly works on the effective usage of Dart programming language and Flutter SDK.
 - The first section involves the creation of a Stateful widget , inside which an AppBar , Container and Options Section is made.
 - The title of the app is given inside the AppBar.
 - Inside the body , I have created a list "questionBank" to get the questions from a source and pasted it as per the question class .
 - The question class is made in a separate dart file and it is used for processing each question.
 - I have created functions "checkAnswer" , which checks whether the option you have picked is correct or wrong .
 - Two material buttons are created to navigate to the previous and the next questions.
 - We can add more questions to the app.
 - The app is ready to use and launch in the store.
